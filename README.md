# SDLRayTracing

This project intends to implement a Ray Tracing algorithm, in C++ using the SDL library to create the images.

The purpose of this project is:

- Improve my habilitites working with C++.
- Create a multi-platform build system with CMake.
- Use newest coding tools as Github Copilot.
- Use clean code design patterns.
- Use CTest as a unit testing tool.
- Manage external and own C++ libraries(static and shared).
